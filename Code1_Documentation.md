**Thematic: Installation of the Software, Github**

**Git**

What is Git?
-	It`s a version control system 
-	It can be used by multiple people at the same time 
-	All versions are safed (you can see your changes and the former versions of your projects)
  
How does Git work?
-	Every time you safe your files, your current files are safe as one version 
-	It only needs local data and ressources to work 
-	It only add data and doesn`t delet it 
-	3 conditions
    - Comitted (the files are safed in the local data base)
    - Staged (vorgemerkt, a changed file that is staged for the next commit) 
    - Modified (changed files that aren`t safed yet) 
-	Index with the staged data for former use 
-	Work flow
    -	Change the files
    -	You stage some of the changed files you want to use in the index (staging-area)
    -	You commit the files in the index, which are now safed as a version of your project 
-	Modified files are changed files that are not safed and not in the index

**Node.js**

What is node.js?
-	It is a JavaScript runtime environment (cross-platform, open-source)
o	Usually JavaScript runs in the web browser
-	It is used for creating server-side and networking web applications
  
How node.js works:
-	It runs in a single progress 
-	It can be used outside of the browser
   
**TypeScript Compiler (tsc)**

The TypeScript Compiler is used to transpile TypeScript code into JavaScript.

**Visual Studio Code (VSC)**

Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor. It`s basically a text-editor. 

**GitHub**
I created a repository to document my learning progress. In our team respository we document our project. 

**Visual Studio Code**

I used VSC to clone my repository. 

**Concepts and Vocabulary**

Repository: can contain multiple files, data and codes (you can store your data in it like in a chest)

Commit: an operation that makes your temporary changes permanent 

Branch: a branch is a copy of a codeline (basically a timeline), it makes it easier to work parallel on a project (different peple can work on different branches of the same file and can bring them back together in the end), branches are independent lines of development (a string of commits)   

Remote: the data is stored in the cloud and can be accesed from another device 

Stage: (vorgemerkt) a changed file that is ready for the next commit

Fetch: the retrieval (Abruf) of data, the data is moved to an alternate location 

Merge: means taking multiple goups of data and combine them into one unified set
