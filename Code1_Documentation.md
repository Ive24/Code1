Git

What is Git?
-	It`s a version control system 
-	It can be used by multiple people at the same time 
-	All versions are safed (you can see your changes and the former versions of your projects)
  
How does Git work?
-	Every time you safe your files, your current files are safe as one version 
-	It only needs local data and ressources to work 
-	It only add data and doesn`t delet it 
-	3 conditions
    - Comitted (the files are safed in the local data base)
    - Staged (vorgemerkt, a changed file that is staged fort he next commit) 
    - Modified (changed files that aren`t safed yet) 
-	Index with the staged data for former use 
-	Work flow
    -	Change the files
    -	You stage some of the changed files you want to use in the index (staging-area)
    -	You commit the files in the index, which are now safed as a version of your project 
-	Modified files are changed files that are not safed and not in the index

Node.js

What is node.js?
-	It is a JavaScript runtime environment (cross-platform, open-source)
o	Usually JavaScript runs in the web browser
-	It is used for creating server-side and networking web applications
  
How node.js works:
-	It runs in a single progress 
-	It can be used outside of the browser
