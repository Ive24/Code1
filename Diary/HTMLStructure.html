    <h1>The structure of HTML files</h1>
    <p>In general an HTML document describes the structure and content of a web page. 
        It can include text, images, links, and other elements. <br>
        An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content and an end tag. <br>
        Some HTML elements have no content (like the br element). 
        These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag. <br>
        An HTML element can also have attributes, which are additional information about the element. 
        Attributes are specified in the start tag and usually have a name and a value. <br>
        HTML documents are displayed in web browsers, which read the HTML code and render it according to the specified structure and style. 
        Web browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to determine how to display the document.
