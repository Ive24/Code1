    <h2>Git</h2>
    <div>
        <h4>Repository</h4> <br>
        <p>
            The repository is a place where you can store your code and your files.
            It contains all information about your project, including a history of all the changes.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Commit</h4> <br>
        <p>
            A commit is a save or permanent snapshot of your entire project/repository at acertain time. 
            Like a "save point" in the project you can go back to. 
            A commit should alwahs include a message to keep track of the changes.
            Git basically stores and manages commits. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Branch</h4> <br>
        <p>
            A branch is a seperate version of the main repository. 
            This allows you to work on multiple aspects of your project at the same time and test new things.
            You can imagine it as a tree where you working on different branches of the same tree (working tree).
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Remote</h4> <br>
        <p>
            Remote means that it's not the local version on your machine.
            A remote version of your repository is available for others (teammembers or the whole world).
            It allows you to work together with people all over the world. (remote, dt.: entfernt, abgelegen).
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>stage</h4> <br>
        <p>
            Stage means to prepare a file finely for a commit. 
            All modified files that will go into the next commit snapshot are stored in the staging are/index.
            Git allows you to commit only certain parts of the changes you have done since the last commit.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>fetch</h4> <br>
        <p>
            It's a command to download new data from a remote repository, but it does not integrate this data into the working files. 
            It also does not modify, destroy or overwrite anything.  It only updates the remote-tracking branches. 
            This makes it useful to get a fresh view of what happend in a remote repository without affecting the local branch.  
            It's important when working on a teamproject. You use fetch to connect your Git to the teammembers Gits and "collect" all of their new commits.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>pull</h4> <br>
        <p>
            Pull is used to fetch and integrate the changes from a remote repository to a local repository. 
            With this command you can update your local repository with the latest changes from the remote repository. 
            It can be seen as a combination of the commands pull and merge. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>push</h4> <br>
        <p>
            This command updates the remote branch with local commits. 
            You update or publish your changes to the remote repository.
            It only updates the correspomding branch on the remote. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>merge</h4> <br>
        <p>
            It's used to merge changes from one branch into another or to incorporate changes from another repository. 
            Merge integrates all changes of one or more branches in another one (dt.: Zusammenführen). 
            It combines the history of the merged branches. 
        </p>

        <h4>.gitignore</h4> <br>
        <p>
            You can use a .gitignore file to specify which parts of your project should be ignored by Git.
            Git does not track files and folder specified in .gitignore. However all files that are already tracked by Git won't be ignored. 
            It can be used for files that you don't want to share, like personal or temporary files.

        <p>
            Squashing a commmit means to move the changes of one commit into it's parent so that you end up with one commit instead of two or more.
            This process can be reapeted multiple times. You can reduce n commit to a single one.

            - input (form) tags to collect information and enable input <br>
            - audio and viedeo tags <br>
            - style and programming tags to define the program <br>
            - meta tags for non-visible information <br>
