    <h2>Git</h2>
    <div>
        <h4>Repository</h4> <br>
        <p>
            The repository is a place where you can store your code and your files.
            It contains all information about your project, including a history of all the changes.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Commit</h4> <br>
        <p>
            A commit is a save or permanent snapshot of your entire project/repository at acertain time. 
            Like a "save point" in the project you can go back to. 
            A commit should alwahs include a message to keep track of the changes.
            Git basically stores and manages commits. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Branch</h4> <br>
        <p>
            A branch is a seperate version of the main repository. 
            This allows you to work on multiple aspects of your project at the same time and test new things.
            You can imagine it as a tree where you working on different branches of the same tree (working tree).
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Remote</h4> <br>
        <p>
            Remote means that it's not the local version on your machine.
            A remote version of your repository is available for others (teammembers or the whole world).
            It allows you to work together with people all over the world. (remote, dt.: entfernt, abgelegen).
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>stage</h4> <br>
        <p>
            Stage means to prepare a file finely for a commit. 
            All modified files that will go into the next commit snapshot are stored in the staging are/index.
            Git allows you to commit only certain parts of the changes you have done since the last commit.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>fetch</h4> <br>
        <p>
            It's a command to download new data from a remote repository, but it does not integrate this data into the working files. 
            It also does not modify, destroy or overwrite anything.  It only updates the remote-tracking branches. 
            This makes it useful to get a fresh view of what happend in a remote repository without affecting the local branch.  
            It's important when working on a teamproject. You use fetch to connect your Git to the teammembers Gits and "collect" all of their new commits.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>pull</h4> <br>
        <p>
            Pull is used to fetch and integrate the changes from a remote repository to a local repository. 
            With this command you can update your local repository with the latest changes from the remote repository. 
            It can be seen as a combination of the commands pull and merge. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>push</h4> <br>
        <p>
            This command updates the remote branch with local commits. 
            You update or publish your changes to the remote repository.
            It only updates the correspomding branch on the remote. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>merge</h4> <br>
        <p>
            It's used to merge changes from one branch into another or to incorporate changes from another repository. 
            Merge integrates all changes of one or more branches in another one (dt.: Zusammenführen). 
            It combines the history of the merged branches. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>.gitignore</h4> <br>
        <p>
            You can use a .gitignore file to specify which parts of your project should be ignored by Git.
            Git does not track files and folder specified in .gitignore. However all files that are already tracked by Git won't be ignored. 
            It can be used for files that you don't want to share, like personal or temporary files. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>rebase</h4> <br>
        <p>
            This command allows you to reorganize your commit history and change the base of your branch.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>squah</h4> <br>
        <p>
            Squashing a commmit means to move the changes of one commit into it's parent so that you end up with one commit instead of two or more.
            This process can be reapeted multiple times. You can reduce n commit to a single one.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>.git</h4> <br>
        <p>
            The .git folder is a hidden folder that contains all the information that Git needs to manage your project's version control.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Sync Changes in VSCode</h4> <br>
        <p>
            It will run a pull command followed by a push command. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <div>
        <h4>HTML</h4> <br>
        <p>
            HTML determines the structure and the content of web pages. <br>

            <span>Hypertext:</span> Text that is organized in order to connect related items
            and to link web pages (within a single website or between different ones). <br>

            <span>Markup: </span> Markup suggest the use of tags to define elements and add information. 
            The markup includes special elements, which consists of the element name sourrounded by "<" and ">". <br>
                
            <span>Language: </span> a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Syntax</h4> <br>
        <p>
            Syntax refers to the rules and principles to write a correct code.
            Syntax is about to the structure.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Semantic</h4> <br>
        <p>
            Semantic means that the tags convey (transfer, provide, dt.: vermitteln) the actual meaning of what they are used for.
            Semantic is about the meaning. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Tags</h4> <br>
        <p>
            You have opening tags (<ElementName>) and closing tags (</ElementName>). In between the two tags the content is written. Both tags and the content form an element. It is possible to put an element inside another element. Tags are used to define different types of content on a webpage. 
            Different categories of tags: <br>
            - structure tags for the overall structure of the webpage <br>
            - image tags <br>
            - formatting tags to change font, color etc. of the shown text <br>
            - navigation tags to define connections with other resources <br>
            - input (form) tags to collect information and enable input <br>
            - audio and viedeo tags <br>
            - style and programming tags to define the program <br>
            - meta tags for non-visible information <br>

    <div>
        <h4>Selector</h4> <br>
        <p>
            This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. 
            It defines the element(s) to be styled.

    <h2>TypeScript and JavaScript</h2>
    <div>
        <h4>TS and JS</h4> <br>
        <p>
             TS and JS are both programming lamguages. They are used to create web applications.
             Both run on the same JS engine and TS needs to be compiled to JS before it can be executed. 
             TS is a superset of JS, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. be
             However there are some differences:
        </p> <br>
        <ul>
            <li>TS is static typed, which means that the type of values is checked at compile time. This helps to prevent type errors.</li>
            <li>JS is dynamic typed, which means that the type of values are checked at runtime. This gives more flexability but increases the potential of more errors at the same time.</li> 
            <li>TS supports interfaces. These are used to ensure consistency and implement abstraction through a defined structure and behavior of objects.</li> 
            <li>TS has a more advanced tooling support than JS.</li> 
            <li>TS has added features and syntax. </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Variable</h4> <br>
        <p>
            A variable is a named unit of data that is assigned a value.
            A new variable is defined through let VariableName;
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Data Type</h4> <br>
        <p>
             To process the information correctly the machine have to knnow the type of the data.
             This can be a number, a text, an image, an audio ...
             To define the exact datatype you write it behind the Name: <br>
             let name: datatype = value; <br>
             <span>Primitive Datatypes:</span> number, string, boolean
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Array</h4> <br>
        <p>
            An array is a container that permits storing multiple piece of data in an ordered list. <br>
            To create a new array you can use either "[]" or "new Array()". <br>
            <span>Associative arrays</span> are basically objects in JavaScript where indexes are replaced by user-defined keys.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Functions</h4> <br>
        <p>
            Functions are modular units of code designed to perform specific tasks.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Object</h4> <br>
        <p>
            An object is an instance which contains set of key value pairs.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Class</h4> <br>
        <p>
            Classes in TypeScript are a foundational concept from object-oriented programming (OOP). 
            They provide a blueprint for creating objects, encompassing both the data attributes and the methods to manipulate this data. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>if/else</h4> <br>
        <p>
            An if-else-condition consists of two blocks. If the if-condition is true, then it's executed otherwise the else-block is executed. <br>
            <span>Firstly the if-block:</span> if (condition) {an action} <br>
            <span>Secondly the else-block:</span> else {another action}
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>for loop</h4> <br>
        <p>
            The for loop is used to execute a block of code a given number of times, which is specified by a condition. <br>
            for (condition) {action}
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>switch</h4> <br>
        <p>
            The switch statement is used to check for multiple values and executes sets of statements for each of those values. 
            A switch statement has one block of code corresponding to each value and can have any number of such blocks. 
            When the match to a value is found, the corresponding block of code is executed.
