    <h1>The basics of CSS</h1>
    <h3>Syntax</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
        <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
        <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>
        <li>You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of them. Separate multiple selectors by commas.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Selectors</h3>
    <p>A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. <br>
        It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them. <br>
        The element or elements which are selected by the selector are referred to as the subject of the selector.</p> <br>
