    <h1>The basics of CSS</h1>
    <h3>Syntax</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
        <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
        <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>
        <li>You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of them. Separate multiple selectors by commas.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Selectors</h3>
    <p>A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. <br>
        It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them. <br>
        The element or elements which are selected by the selector are referred to as the subject of the selector.</p> <br>
    <h3>Selector lists</h3>
    <p>If you have more than one elementusing the same selector you can combine them in a list.
        You can do this by adding a comma between them (white space is valid before or after the comma).
    </p> <br>
    <h3>DIfferent Types of Selectors</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Type Selector: it targets an html element, e.g. my-element</li>
        <li>Class Selector: it targets an element with a specified class, e.g. .my-class</li> 
        <li>ID Selector: it targets an elementwith a certain id, e.g. #my-id</li> 
        <li>Attribute Selector: it targets elements with specified attributes</li>
        <li>Pseudo-class Selector: it only targets the elements when they are in a specified state</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>CSS Boxes</h3>
    <p>CSS is based on the box model system. <br>
    Each box placed on your page is taking up sapce and has properties like: </p> <br>
    <ul>
        <li>padding: the space around the content</li>
        <li>border: the line that is just outside the padding</li>
        <li>margin: the space around the outside of the border</li>
        <li>CSS knows the directions in the order: above, right, under, left</li>
        <li>others: universal selector (asteriks), hierarchy</li>
    </ul>
