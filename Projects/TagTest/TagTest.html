Make me laugh over coffee, <br>
make it a double, make it frothy <br>
so it seethes in our delight. <br>
Make my cup overflow <br>
with your small happiness. <br>
I want to hoot and snort and cackle and chuckle. <br>
Let your laughter fill me like a bell. <br>
Let me listen to your ringing and singing <br>
as Billie Holiday croons above our heads. <br>
Sorry, the blues are nowhere to be found. <br>
Not tonight. Not here. <br>
No makeup. No tears. <br>
Only contours. Only curves. <br>
Each sip takes back a pound, <br>
each dry-roasted swirl takes our soul. <br>
Can I have a refill, just one more? <br>
Let the bitterness sink to the bottom of our lives. <br>
Let us take this joy to go. <br>
