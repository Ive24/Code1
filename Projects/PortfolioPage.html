    <h2>The game i cannot stop to play but probaly never going to finish</h2>
    <p>In this case i'm talking aout BG3. 
        I love to test every option and see how my choices impact the gameplay.
        The only problem is that i tend to start over and over again but never finish one of the started plays.
